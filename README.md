## **Overview**

### **Description**

Welcome to the CubeSAT Mission Simulation Project, an ambitious endeavor that propels you into the forefront of space exploration and satellite technology. This project is designed to provide participants with a hands-on experience in conceptualizing, planning, and executing a simulated CubeSAT (Cube Satellite) mission.

CubeSats, small standardized satellites typically weighing no more than a few kilograms, have revolutionized space research by offering a cost-effective and accessible platform for scientific experiments, technology demonstrations, and educational outreach. In our simulation project, participants will step into the shoes of aerospace engineers, mission planners, and project managers to navigate the complexities of launching a CubeSAT into orbit.
